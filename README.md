# team-profile-generator

## Description

Application Demonstration Video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kh1-iw9CNqLrecbA0nKH-6TwU0NPhAF9/view

- The motivation to complete this challenge was to test my own skills gained in the most recent week of the coding bootcamp, including but not limited to: Constructors, Polymorphism, Promisies & Async, Tests and Classes.
- This project was built as a testing ground for my own retention of the aforementioned skills.
- This application allows a team leader to generate a team through a series of clear, concise prompts, and view the result in a clean html output format.
- Through building this application, I learnt that there are many programming skills outside of what we learn throughout the week, and that research and collaboration is critical in order to achieve the best outcome for any given project.

## Usage

Using GitBash, navigate to the application directory until index.js is visible. Once inside, use command prompt 'node index.js' to begin a series of prompts requesting information from the user.

The user will be asked for details on each team member they would like into their team, including name, ID's, github usernames and others.

Once the user has added as many team members as they want, they are to select "I do not want to add any more team members", and the html will be generated. Using the VScode live server they will then be able to view their created team. Combined with github pages, an official link may be generated like the one below:\
